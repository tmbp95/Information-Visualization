#### Why Counter-Strike?

Counter-Strike: Global Offensive is a first-person shooter game and one of the most played games around the world. When fans talk about the professional scene in this game, there are contradictory opinions about which is the best team or player ever. The main goal was to solve this topic by a visual/statistical way.

#### Defined tasks of the project:
#### 1. Type: Searching
> Description: Allows searching for a team or player which leads to their stats, either in a particular tournament or for all tournaments. On the last case, it's possible to specify a limit and get statistics of a certain period of time.

#### 2. Type: Exploring 
> Description: The tournaments are indexed and their stats can be consulted. It’s possible to check which team won; who was the player with the highest Average Damage per Round or the highest rating of that tournament; which player has the most kills; who died more and what was the most played map. We will also index maps and make possible to know which player has the biggest rating in that map, the percentage of rounds won by Terrorist vs Counter-Terrorist side and the number of times that map has been played in tournaments. Combining all the stats from all the tournaments we will be able to know who is the best player of all, which is the best team, the most played map as well as the prize money.

#### 3. Type: Comparison
> Description: A comparator that allows picking two teams or two players and compare them in several aspects like total wins, number of tournaments engaged, what prizes were won, number of kills, deaths.

#### 4. Type: Relation
> Description: Relation between a specific player’s rating and his team rating average and measure the difference between them.
